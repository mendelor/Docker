How to configure docker context:



1.Master

ssh-keygen -t rsa
cd ~/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub


2.Worker:

cd ~/.ssh
ls
vim authorized_keys
(Copy the id_rsa.pub from the Master)


3. After copying the keys, run the following commands:

/> ssh root@3.129.15.58
/> docker context create  --docker "host=ssh://root@3.129.15.58" test2
/> docker context use default
/> docker swarm init
/> docker context use default


Works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I run visualizer on the master to see where the container is running!!!
Although you see the container from the server you create the context, it is running on the master

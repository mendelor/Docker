1.Master

ssh-keygen -t rsa
cd ~/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub


2.Worker:

cd ~/.ssh
ls
vim authorized_keys
(Copy the id_rsa.pub from the Master)


3. After copying the keys, run the following commands:

/> ssh root@3.129.15.58
/> docker context create  --docker "host=ssh://root@3.129.15.58" test2
/> docker context use default
/> docker swarm init
/> docker context use default


Works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I run visualizer on the master to see where the container is running!!!
Although you see the container from the server you create the context, it is running on the master 



The docker context command makes it easy to export and import contexts on different machines with the Docker client installed.
You can use the docker context export command to export an existing context to a file.
This file can later be imported on another machine that has the docker client installed.
